Plot_RMSE

In the context of studies carried out with twin experiments, this code will read NetCdf files
from Mordor_SD_Assimilation_ensemble_Twin_experiment.py
one file by truth, and with assimilation (expAssim) and without assimilation (Ref)

RMSE of cumulative of Q and S (on each level), compared to observation is calculated over the time period
between d_ini_plot and d_fin_plot
for the expereience and the reference

Plot of the ratio of RMSE (RMSE_with_assimilation / RMSE_without_assimilation) 
of S is done (for each level), and another one for Q.
